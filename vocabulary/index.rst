Qeios Vocabulary
================

There are some terms that one needs to know to be able to use the Qeios API in a proper way.

Publication
-----------

It indicates either an Article, a Definition or a Review. These represent the objects that one can write and publish on Qeios. A Publication can either be in a ``published`` or ``draft`` state. When a Publication is published, nobody can edit its content.

Definition
----------

On Qeios, a Definition is any piece of information which represents a notion, concept or entity valuable for and usable by the scientific community. There are two kinds of Definitions:

* Original Definition
    Novel or derivative Definitions which have never been published anywhere.
* Non-Original Definition (aka ``Echo Definition``)
    Definitions which have already been published somewhere.

In addition to Title and Body, one must provide Authorship and Source of an ``Echo Definition`` to be able to publish it.

Vacant Author
-------------

A Vacant Author is the attribution that the creator of an Echo Definition gives to authors listed in the Source of the Definition. The full authorship should be specified (by adding Vacant Authors) before publishing an Echo Definition.
